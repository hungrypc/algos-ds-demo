## Algorithms and Datastructures Visualization 

A small and simple app that breaks down algorithms + datastructures and explains how they work by going through them line by line to visualize what exactly is happening, including other information. Mainly building this to improve my own understanding of each topic, but it'd be nice to see if the completed version of this app will be able to help teach other developers who are starting their process of learning these fundamentals.

Will include:
- Problem Solving Patterns
- Recursion
- Sorting Algorithms
  - Visualization & Comparison
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Traversal
- Binary Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
  - Traversal
  - Dijkstra's
