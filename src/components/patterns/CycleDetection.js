  const brief = `Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers, where each pointer moves at different speeds. 
The idea is to move a fast pointer twice as quickly as the slow pointer. The distance between them increases by 1 at each step. 
If at some point both meet, we have found a cycle in the list. This is also known as the "tortoise and the hare algorithm".

Though typically used for linked lists, the following question can utilize this algorithm.
The values of the array are like pointers that point to indices (which we can treat as nodes). Since each value is 1..n (inclusive), then the values will have to point
to a valid index. Because we are told that there is a duplicate number, there will definitely be a cycle.`;

  const prompt = `Given an array nums containing n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
  Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
  There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.`;
